Cyber Security Training Resources

###Suggested exercises:
- MUST start off with security contract. 
- Explain what kind of data we must protect, why private information needs to remain private, what the consequences are for not being secure.
- Social engineering. This is big. Explain how to recognize these threats. As long as a network has a human element to it, it is vulnerable to this, and all the intrusion detection in the world can't sidestep that.
- Simple beginner exercise: explain routers' vulnerability to DNS poisoning and show how to configure network settings to use Google DNS.
- Netstat and how to use it to see incoming connections.
- Using [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/) to forge packets
- Using wireshark to sniff traffic
- Inspect the source code of e.g. Flask for security updates. Look at what was changed and why. [Flask Source](https://github.com/pallets/flask)
