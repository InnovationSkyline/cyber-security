## Windows Challenge

Hello and welcome new warriors. Now that you have completed the first phase in your windows command line training, you must prove your skills in order to become a true warrior. You are being sent on a mission to the faraway land of Aedretara where a dragon gaurds some stollen treasure. Please complete the following, but hurry you dont have much time!  
	
  1. In your Windows 10 virtual machine, open up a terminal and rename it The Enchanted land of Aedretara. 
  2. Move into your Desktop directory and make a new directory named "The White Kingdom".
	3. Inside The White Kingdom directory, create two directories called "Castle" and "Dragon".
	4. Inside Castle create a file called Queen.txt with the text "Please save our treasure from the Dragon".
	5. Copy the Queen.txt file to the Dragon directory and rename it Treasure.txt.
	6. In the Treasure.txt file overwrite the text with a list of 10 treasurable items(example: Jewels, Art, Stories, gold, Secrets, seeds, etc.)
	7. Thankfully you have been trained in the ways of the windows command line and can help. Open up an administrator command prompt and create a new user with your warrior name and a password. (example warrior=Alexi password=M1ghtyW@rri0r)
	8. In order for you to become a great warrior and rescue the treasure, you must make your user account an Administrator.
	9. Oh no the dragon is out of control, It looks like it ate the treasure! Move the treature into the Castle directory and delete the dragon once and for all.
	10. Great Job! You saved the Treasure from the Dragon and saved the Kingdom. Show an instructor what you did to get credit
