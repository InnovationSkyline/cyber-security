# OPEN SOURCE INTELLIGENCE GATHERING FINAL PROJECT 

"If I had 8 hours to chop down a tree, I would spend 6 sharpening the blade."

                -Abraham Lincoln
                
## Overview
Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the first, longest and arguably the most important part of a penetration test. It is basically all of the information that can be obtained from publicaly available sources. The information gathered, would then be used to determine possible vulnerabilities that could be exploited.  
When conducting an OSINT investigation, it is important to remember that their are two types of tools you may use- Passive and Active tools. Passive tools get their information in a way where the target was not touched, and where there is no trace/log of the activiy. Active tools will cross the boundry and actually penetrate the target 

## Part 1: Gather Inforamtion
You have been hired by ________________________ to conduct an Open Source Intelligence Investigation of the company, evaluate their potential security risk, and give the company suggestions to improve their security posture. You will ONLY be gathering information on your specified company in order to write a report. You will need to use the knowledge you have gained this year, and the following tools to complete this project. 

### Possible Businesses
- The Honolulu Star Advertiser
- Hawaiian Airlines / Island Air
- HMSA
- Hawaiian Electrice Company
- Island Energy
- Board of Water Supply
- Your School
- Wet n' Wild
- Other Local Companies (doctors offices, restaurants, places you visit, etc.)


### Tools to use
1. [OSINT Framework](http://osintframework.com/) Start with this set of tools! This is the main site used which has most of the tools I used.
2. [Google hacking database](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/)
3. Whois command (on linux)
  The syntax is very simple and is whois thewebsite.com
4. [Netcraft](https://searchdns.netcraft.com/)
5. Check public records
5. Check for job openings, linkedin profiles, social media profiles
6. Nessus web application scan

### Resources
A sample penetration test report. Remember this project is only information gathering:

## Part 2: Presentation
From the OSINT you have gathered you need to create a professional report detailing the information you found, the tools used, and your suggestions on how the company/business could improve their security posture.
