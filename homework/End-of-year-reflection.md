# End of Year Reflection

Sadly the school year has come to an end and we would like to hear your thoughts and feedback. Please write one last, final blog reflecting on this class. Please feel free to be honest and constructive as your feedback will help us in the future. Thank you all for an amazing year and have a great summer~

Your blog should be about a 3 minute read and answer the following questions (BE SPECIFIC):
1. What did you enjoy/learn in this class? (Example: a favorite project, topic, or lecture)
2. What did you not like about the class?
3. What advice/warning would you give future students who are thinking about taking the class?
4. Were your expectations of the class met?
5. What grade do you think you deserve for the semester and why?
6. Is there anything you wish you learned?
