# Blog Assignment - Find Your Cyber Interest

### Mission<br>
**Your mission, should you choose to accept:**

You're a news reporter tasked to create a new beat covering cybersecurity. The online media company you work for doesn't have many technically inclined people so they're looking to you to bring some new blood into the publication.

Your task is to begin to find your niche and determine where you're going to jump in first. It's such a broad landscape, where would you even begin?

Your boss has asked for the following:

- Create a Medium blog and post your first article on anything cyber related that you think might draw some readership.
- Your blog post should be at least a 3 min read.
- A few example topics could be cyber bullying, recent cyber attacks, cyberwarfare, how to stay safe online, and more. Try to pick one topic to research in depth.

**GO!!!**
