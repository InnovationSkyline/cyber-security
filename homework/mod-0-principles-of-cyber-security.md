# Principles of Cyber Security

### Your task is to write a blog post that goes more in depth about something we talked about in class this week. Some suggested topics to write about are:

1. The CIA Triad and what each of the letters stands for
2. The difference between data and information and how we use both
3. What it takes to build a strong password
4. Cyber Threats (Shoulder surfing, Dumpster diving, Social Engineering, Phishing, Spear Phishing, Vishing, & Smishing)
5. The different types of malware (trojan, zombie, bots, spyware)
6. Keyloggers
7.  The difference between a virus and a worm
8. Who Edward Snowden is and what he did that made him controversial
9. A career your interested in or a Cyber Security career
10. Something else you are interested in that deals with Cyber Security


Have fun with your blog post and try to research something you are interested in. Your post should be a 3-5 minute read, gramatically free of errors, have paragraphs and follow the class rubric.
