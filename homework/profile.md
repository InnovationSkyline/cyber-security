# Social Engineering, Profiling and Open Source Intelligence Gathering

### Social Engineering is defined as "the act of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information". If you have ever tried to convince someone of something, or manipulate them to get something you want, then you have done some social engineering. If you have ever googled someone to try to find out information about them then you have preformed OSINT.

If you have ever watched a spy movie then you know the scene where the secret agent tries to find out information on a target to manipulate them. Your task is to gather information, and build a profile on me (Miss Alyssa)! Let's see how well you have been paying attention so far and how much information you can gather on me. Think about what information might be valuable if you were going to social engineer me, or conduct some kind of cyber attack. Things like where I live, what I like to do, anything interesting on social media, Passwords, etc. 

Note: You have my permission to preform any type of PASSIVE reconnaissance. That means you cannot interact with me at all.
