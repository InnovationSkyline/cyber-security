### Topics 
- On Sunday 11/5/17 we had our first round of Cyber Patriot where teams scored between 140-170 out of 200. But teams had trouble with the packet tracer and networking portion.
- Today we started class by going around and talking about one thing we have learned so far and one thing we want to learn coming up.
- Some things they learned are teamwork strategies, file searching using commands, time management, some linux commands, etc.
- Some things they want to learn include scripting, more knowledge of vulnerabilities and how to fix them, ports, some packet tracer, specific search commands, etc.
- Then we moved to computers and worked on a packet tracer example from Ciscos netacad that they turned in as an in-class assignmnet/homework grade.
- The goal for the nest 4 weeks is to keep practicing linux and using commands so it feels easy. And then to also work on more vulnerabilities and how to address them.

GOOD JOB!!!!
